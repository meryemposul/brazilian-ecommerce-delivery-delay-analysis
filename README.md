# Brazilian E-Commerce Delivery Delay Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes delivery delays in Brazilian e-commerce orders using the
Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset (Olist).

The goal is to understand which factors contribute to late deliveries and how
delivery performance impacts customer satisfaction.

## Dataset
- Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist
- Source: Kaggle

## Scope
- 100k+ real e-commerce orders
- Multiple datasets merged (orders, customers, items, payments, reviews)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Analysis Workflow
- Data merging and cleaning
- Feature engineering (delivery delay, order value)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Classification modeling (delayed vs on-time)
- Business insight generation

## Key Insights
- Higher freight costs significantly increase delivery delay probability.
- Delayed deliveries strongly correlate with lower review scores.
- Logistics performance is a key driver of customer satisfaction.
